## About

This Project is designed to advance my knowlage of next.js projects. </br>
Since I am a fan of monkeytyper and I am missing somethings in the orginal one, I tried to recreate the Game into my own Design and my with own Functions. </br>
Currently this project is still **W.I.P** and is only a side Project.
