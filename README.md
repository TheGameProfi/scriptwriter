W.I.P – The project is not yet stable, and is currently in a semi-active development.

---

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start playing the Game.

**Docker Compose**
When using Docker Compose, don't forget to modify the compose file, since mine has an reverseProxy and no open Ports

## About

This project is designed to advance my knowledge of Next.js projects. </br>
As a fan of monkeytyper, I missed some features in the original version, so I tried to recreate the game with my own design and functions. </br>
Currently, this project is still a **W.I.P** and is only a side project.
